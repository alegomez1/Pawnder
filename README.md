### Why Make This?

Pawnder was created so dog owners can each other and set up playdates. Dog parks can be a good way to meet local dogs, but you just never know who's going to be there, and wheter or not your dog might get along with them. That's where Pawnder comes in! You can search for your city to see all local dogs, and filter them based on their breeds and activity levels. You know your dog best and with Pawnder you can find their perfect playdate.
